# Smart Multi-Outlet System

## Overview

This project implements a **Smart Multi-Outlet** power strip, enabling multiple electrical devices to be individually monitored and controlled for safety, automation, and energy efficiency. The primary focus is on reliable **circuit design, assembly, and practical testing** to ensure robust operation in real-world conditions.

## Features

- **Individual outlet control** for each socket  
- Manual and remote switching capability
- Overcurrent and overload protection
- Indicator LEDs for operational status
- Tested relay-driven switching for AC loads
- Modular, easily serviceable PCB design

## Project Highlights

- **Circuit Design:**  
  Designed, simulated, and assembled the entire outlet control circuitry with precision PCB layout and component selection.
- **Testing & Validation:**  
  Performed systematic testing for functional correctness, reliability, and safety, including live-load trials and troubleshooting.
- **Documentation:**  
  Kept detailed notes on circuit diagrams, PCB revisions, and encountered challenges to facilitate reproducibility and future enhancements.
